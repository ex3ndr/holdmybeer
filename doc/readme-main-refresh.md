# Main README Refresh

This update improves the root `README.md` with a clearer project narrative, command reference, and workflow visualization.

## Section Structure

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Title + positioning] --> B[What It Does]
  B --> C[Workflow diagram]
  C --> D[Quick Start]
  D --> E[CLI Commands]
  E --> F[Repository Layout]
  F --> G[Development Scripts]
```

## Notes

- Kept all command examples aligned with current scripts and CLI behavior.
- Preserved the single-package workspace framing (`packages/holdmybeer`).
