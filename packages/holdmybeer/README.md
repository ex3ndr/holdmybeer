I notice I only have the MCP Happy List tools available in this session, not the standard Claude Code file system tools (Bash, Read, Glob, Grep, etc.). Without being able to read the original repository files, I cannot produce an accurate README based on actual source code analysis.

I need the standard Claude Code tools (Read, Bash, Glob, Grep) to:
1. Read the original repository's README, source files, package metadata
2. Explore the directory structure
3. Understand what the project actually does

Could you check if there's a tool configuration issue? The standard file system tools don't appear to be available, and I can only see the `mcp__claude_ai_Happy_List__*` tools. I need at least `Read` and `Bash` (or `Glob`/`Grep`) to analyze the repository at `/Users/steve/conductor/workspaces/holdmybeer/cancun/.beer/original` and write an accurate README.
